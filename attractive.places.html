                Jim Thompson House, considered an outstanding example of Thai architecture. As the seat of the Thai
                government and the royal family, Bangkok is also a hub for major cultural events, such as religious

            <p class="lead"> Paris attracted over 16 million foreign tourists in 2015, and it is well behind the first
                and second-place cities. Nonetheless, Paris remains a top-tier destination for many travelers, often
                considered a must-take trip or a bucket-list destination. The capital of France is noted for its
                cuisine, including its many bistros and cafes, along with many 3-star restaurants. The Arc de Triomphe,
                the Palace of Versailles, the Notre Dame Cathedral and the Louvre are all popular tourist attractions.
                Paris is also known as a center of fashion, hosting the twice annual Paris Fashion Week. The city is
                also the host of several important sporting events, including the finish of the Tour de France and the

                Its skyline is dominated by the Burj Khalifa, currently the world’s tallest building at 828 meters. The
                Burj al Arab is another iconic structure. Dubai’s attitude is clearly go big or go home: the Dubai
                Miracle Garden, opened in 2013, is the world’s largest flower garden and the Dubai Mall is the largest
                mall in the world. More than 14 million people are expected to visit Dubai from other countries in 2015

                positioning on the edge of both Europe and Asia. It was named a European Capital of Culture in 2012. The
                city boasts mosques and churches, bazaars and malls and a treasure trove of other attractions.
